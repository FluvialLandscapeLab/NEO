Description: NEO allows R users to construct and manage complex simulation models where systems are represented as networks (graphs) through which "currencies" flow.  The currencies are stored in network vertices and flow through network edges.  Flow rates are calculated from vertex and edge attributes, which themselves may be dynamic.
